# CNN Classifier
##Introduction:
This report compares the performance of various models for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using PyTorch. We explore a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Faster R-CNN, fine-tuned VGG16 and AlexNet models, and analyze their accuracy, F1 score, loss, and training time.

##Models:
1.CNN: This is a standard CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
